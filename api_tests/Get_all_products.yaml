      # This scenario tests the functionality of the "Get All Products" API endpoint.
      # It sends a GET request to the "/products" URL and expects a 200 status code in response.
      # The response should contain a 'products' property that is an empty array, 
      # indicating that there are currently no products.
      # It also checks that each product in the response has the properties 'id', 'name', 'description', and 'price'.
      # The types of these properties are also checked to ensure they match the expected types.
